# **Project Title : Motor Vehicle Crashes Analysis**

## **Source Datasets:**
1. https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Austin-Crash-Report-Data-Crash-Level-Records/y2wy-tgr5/about_data
2. https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/about_data
3. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data

## **Project Description:**
1. Conducted extensive Data profiling using YData Profiling & Alteryx Designer, to meticulously analyze data from all 3 SORs to produce in-depth findings along with an intricated mapping document
2. Implemented a Star-Schema based Dimensional Model (tailored for intricate Business Intelligence (BI) queries) using ER Studio emphasizing a Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 and audit columns ; for data precision and historical traceability 
3. Talend ETL tool was instrumental in Staging the data in Azure Data Studio.
4. Orchestrated Talend ETL jobs ; utilizing contexts, settings, and metadata-driven links to integrate data from diverse data sources (such as MySQL tables, JSON files and CSVs) , clean the integrated data and then transform it as per preprocessing requirements.
5. Post ingesting transformed data, we employed real-time PowerBI and Tableau dashboards encompassing significant KPIs and wrote SQL validation queries for all BI questions : for effective interpretation and presentation of data and ensuring accuracy through a meticulous comparison with the generated visuals.
